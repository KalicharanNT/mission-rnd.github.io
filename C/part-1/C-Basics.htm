  <div> <h2> C-Basics</h2></div>
  <p>First of All Congrats on getting selected to Mission RnD C-Course .This is a 8-9 Week course 
    where the topics being covered will be Basics ,Arrays ,Strings ,Linked -Lists , Binary Serach Trees
    ,Recursion , Dynamic Programming etc and 1-2 Medium-scale console applications .
  </p>
  <p>
    Each Project will have a tutorial which will give a breif overview of the Tasks you will be doing and sample codes which will further strengthen your C-Skills .
  </p>
  <h4>How to utilize this course to full extent :</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Read Tutorial page in every project and execute the sample codes,Code the pseudocode given.Scroll to the bottom to view Tips,Notes,SampleCodes etc </li>
    <li>Read each question carefully and try to think of various possible Test cases first,Dont just stick to the example cases</li>
    <li>Practice writing good readable and modular code .This topic will be focussed later in this Course.</li>
    <li>Read any reference links provided ,and only go to next project when you are confident on the current topic you learnt.There are tons of practice questions available online .</li>
    <li>Make a Daily Habit of Coding for the course rather than 1-2 days before the Deadlines , we are tracking your submissions rate ,So even if some of you submit 100% questions ,Those who submitted first might get preference ,assuming all other factors are same .</li>
    <li>The more you practice ,the easy it would be to pass Further tests and Interviews we conduct </li>
    <li>Complete the Projects required before the Deadline ,as <b>we will stop tracking your progress on those projects after deadline </b></li>
    <li><b>100% C Course Completion is mandatory for Getting considered for Summer Program</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How to Test & Submit using Project Tracker Tool :</h4>
  <ul>

  <li>Download the required Project from the Dropdown and give it a location where it gets saved.(I hope you already know this step ,or you wont see this page unless you know where this is hosted )</li>
  <li>Go to the directory where you saved and open the Projectname.Sln file using Visual Studio 2013 express</li>
  <li>You can also open project directly from VS2013 using File->Open Project </li>
  <li>You will see 2 projects ,src and spec .Src project has the files which you need to code .</li>
  <li>Write your code in the respective function stub in the files present in src->Source folder </li>
  <li>To pass sample inputs to your function and observe the output , Call the function from Main{ProjectName} file which has a main function .It is recommended to test your functions only from here</li>
  <li><b>Having two functions with same name in either of the files in the project leads to MSBuild failure ,so you cant run your tests .This includes even the main function .You cant have two mains decalared in 2 of your files .</b></li>
  <li>One solution is to rename helper functions like ,sort1(),sort2() or place them in a common Header File</li>
  <li>After you code your function stub , Run Tests from <b>Test->Run->All Tests </b>It runs testcases of All problems in the project </li>
  <li>It shows the list of test cases passed or failed ,You can click on failed test cases and see in bottom left window where they failed or the Expected result.</li>
  <li>Once a problem has passed all tests related to it ,You can go to the Project Tracker Tool again ,and then click on The Problem you just coded.(If the code you wrote isnt visible in the right window ,do click on any other problem and click back on this problem ),Now click on Test on the above .It takes some time for first time run .</li>
  <li>You will see Test Failed or TestsPassed Message .If failed go to VS2013 and code again correctly </li>
  <li>Once all tests have been cleared ,Click on Submit (<b>Click on submit only after you passed all test cases ,or else partial results will be stored .</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><b>Have fun Coding ,Let the C course begin </b></h4>
  <br/>
  <h4>Readable Code sample :</h4>
  <textarea id='problem1' name='problem1' rows='10' cols='80'>
int get_gcd(int num1,int num2){
  /*
  Returns Gcd of two positive numbers.Returns -1 for invalid inputs .
  */
  if(num1<0 || num2 <0){
    return -1;
  }
  if(num1==0 && num2==0){
    return -1;

    }

      min=num2;
    }
    for(divisor=min;divisor>=1;divisor--){
      if(((num1 % divisor)==0)&&((num2%divisor)==0)){
        return divisor;
      }
    }

  }

  return -1;

  int num2=20;
  int gcd=get_gcd(num1,num2);
  printf("Gcd of 10 and 20 is %d",gcd);
